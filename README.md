This repository contains code for the paper Event-Triggered Maps of Dynamics: A Framework for Modelling Spatial Motion Patterns in Non-Stationary Environments.

## About
This work automatically identifies regions of interest and uses Neural SDEs to model temporal changes in motion patterns. A diffusion model is integrated to generate intermediate data for the framework.
